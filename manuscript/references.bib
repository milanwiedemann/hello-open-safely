              requires new approaches for the timely analysis of large
              datasets. Working on behalf of NHS England, we created
              OpenSAFELY-a secure health analytics platform that covers 40\% of
              all patients in England and holds patient data within the
              existing data centre of a major vendor of primary care electronic
              health records. Here we used OpenSAFELY to examine factors
              associated with COVID-19-related death. Primary care records of
              17,278,392 adults were pseudonymously linked to 10,926
              COVID-19-related deaths. COVID-19-related death was associated
              with: being male (hazard ratio (HR) 1.59 (95\% confidence
              interval 1.53-1.65)); greater age and deprivation (both with a
              strong gradient); diabetes; severe asthma; and various other
              medical conditions. Compared with people of white ethnicity,
              Black and South Asian people were at higher risk, even after
              adjustment for other factors (HR 1.48 (1.29-1.69) and 1.45
              (1.32-1.58), respectively). We have quantified a range of
              clinical factors associated with COVID-19-related death in one of
              the largest cohort studies on this topic so far. More patient

               first COVID-19 vaccination. Aim: Describe trends and variation
               in vaccine coverage by clinical and demographic groups. Design
               and Setting: With the approval of NHS England, we conducted a
               cohort study of 57.9 million patient records in general practice
               in England, in-situ and within the infrastructure of the
               Electronic Health Record (EHR) software vendors EMIS and TPP
               using OpenSAFELY. Method: We describe vaccine coverage across
               various subgroups of Joint Committee on Vaccination and
               Immunisation (JCVI) priority cohorts. Results: 20,852,692
               patients (36\%) received a vaccine between December 8th and
               March 17th 2021. Of patients aged $\geq$80 not in a care home
               (JCVI group 2) 94.7\% received a vaccine, but with substantial
               variation by ethnicity (White 96.2\% vaccinated, Black 68.3\%)
               and deprivation (least deprived 96.6\%, most deprived 90.7\%).
               Patients with pre-existing medical conditions were more likely
               to be vaccinated with two exceptions: severe mental illness
               (89.5\% vaccinated) and learning disability (91.4\%). 275,205
               vaccine recipients were identified as care home residents
               (priority group 1; 91.2\% coverage). 1,257,914 (6.0\%)
               recipients have had a second dose. Detailed characteristics of
               all cohorts are reported. Conclusion: The NHS in England has
               rapidly delivered mass vaccination. We deployed a data
               monitoring framework using publicly auditable methods and a
               secure, in-situ processing model, using linked but pseudonymised
               patient-level NHS data on 57.9 million patients. Targeted

              least 4 weeks after onset of acute COVID-19. Clinical codes to
              describe this phenomenon were recently created. AIM: To describe
              the use of long-COVID codes, and variation of use by general
              practice, demographic variables, and over time. DESIGN AND
              SETTING: Population-based cohort study in English primary care.
              METHOD: Working on behalf of NHS England, OpenSAFELY data were
              used encompassing 96\% of the English population between 1
              February 2020 and 25 May 2021. The proportion of people with a
              recorded code for long COVID was measured overall and by
              demographic factors, electronic health record software system
              (EMIS or TPP), and week. RESULTS: Long COVID was recorded for 23
              273 people. Coding was unevenly distributed among practices, with
              26.7\% of practices having never used the codes. Regional
              variation ranged between 20.3 per 100 000 people for East of
              England (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 19.3 to 21.4) and 55.6
              per 100 000 people in London (95\% CI = 54.1 to 57.1). Coding was
              higher among females (52.1, 95\% CI = 51.3 to 52.9) than males
              (28.1, 95\% CI = 27.5 to 28.7), and higher among practices using
              EMIS (53.7, 95\% CI = 52.9 to 54.4) than those using TPP (20.9,
              95\% CI = 20.3 to 21.4). CONCLUSION: Current recording of long
              COVID in primary care is very low, and variable between
              practices. This may reflect patients not presenting; clinicians
              and patients holding different diagnostic thresholds; or
              challenges with the design and communication of diagnostic codes.
              Increased awareness of diagnostic codes is recommended to
              facilitate research and planning of services, and also surveys
              with qualitative work to better evaluate clinicians'
              understanding of the diagnosis.",

  abstract  = "Thromboembolism has been reported as a consequence of severe
               COVID-19. Although warfarin is a commonly used anticoagulant, it
               acts by antagonising vitamin K, which is low in patients with
               severe COVID-19. To date, the clinical evidence on the impact of
               regular use of warfarin on COVID-19-related thromboembolism is
               lacking. On behalf of NHS England, we conducted a
               population-based cohort study investigating the association
               between warfarin and COVID-19 outcomes compared with direct oral
               anticoagulants (DOACs). We used the OpenSAFELY platform to
               analyse primary care data and pseudonymously linked SARS-CoV-2
               antigen testing data, hospital admissions and death records from
               England. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs)
               for COVID-19-related outcomes comparing warfarin with DOACs in
               people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. We also conducted
               negative control outcome analyses (being tested for SARS-CoV-2
               and non-COVID-19 death) to assess the potential impact of
               confounding. A total of 92,339 warfarin users and 280,407 DOAC
               users were included. We observed a lower risk of all outcomes
               associated with warfarin versus DOACs [testing positive for
               SARS-CoV-2, HR 0.73 (95\% CI 0.68--0.79); COVID-19-related
               hospital admission, HR 0.75 (95\% CI 0.68--0.83);
               COVID-19-related deaths, HR 0.74 (95\% CI 0.66--0.83)]. A lower
               risk of negative control outcomes associated with warfarin
               versus DOACs was also observed [being tested for SARS-CoV-2, HR
               0.80 (95\% CI 0.79--0.81); non-COVID-19 deaths, HR 0.79 (95\% CI
               0.76--0.83)]. Overall, this study shows no evidence of harmful
               effects of warfarin on severe COVID-19 disease.",
