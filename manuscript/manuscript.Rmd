# References

Adding a reference from a bib file that gets automatically created by Paperpile [@Curtis2021-an].
Here's another OpenSAFELY paper @Williamson2020-dt.

# Calculations

Some complex calculations here.

```{r}
# Let's use R to solve this for us and store the result in a new object
results <- 1 + 1

# Return results here
results
```

We can also use inline R chunks to return the result in a sentence.
The answer of our problem above is: `r results`.

## Tables

```{r mtcars, }
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:4,1:4], 
             caption = "The mtcars data.")
```

Really important numbers, see Table \@ref(tab:mtcars).
